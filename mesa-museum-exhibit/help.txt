If port is already taken, use - 

    mac     : sudo lsof -i :3000
    windows : netstat -ano | findstr :3000

    this essentially kills any process happening on port 3000 allowing the server to run instead

To start the server, 
    - initialize the package (all the files are already included but just in case) by running "chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh". If you still get an error try running "node --version" and if it's not 19 or above, install the up-to-date LTS version of node.js from internet.

    - run "chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh" to start the server.

    - you can also make your life easier by running ' alias run="./start.sh" ' and then using run everytime you want to start the server.
