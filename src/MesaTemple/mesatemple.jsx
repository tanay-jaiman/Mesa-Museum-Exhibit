                  The Mesa Arizona Temple, formally the Arizona Temple, was the
                  first Latter-day Saints Temple in Arizona.  There was a need
                  for a Latter-day Saints Temple in Arizona as Mormons had to
                  travel to Utah for the nearest temple.  Located on Main Street
                  and LeSueur Street, construction on the temple began in 1922. 
                  The temple was completed and dedicated in October 1927.  Since
                  then, the temple has been rededicated twice for renovations,
                  once in 1975 and again in 2021.

                  The Mesa Arizona Temple was the first temple to present the
                  endowment in a language other than English, presenting in
                  Spanish in 1945. For many years the temple was also known as
                  the “Lamanite Temple” since it was the destination of annual
                  temple excursions for both Hispanic and Native American
                  members of the Church.
                  <br /> <br />
                  The Church decided to hold a competition for the design of the
                  temple and the winning design was proposed by Don Carlos Young
